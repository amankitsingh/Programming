```
We are given an array Arr[] of length n. It represents the price of a stock on ‘n’ days.
The following guidelines need to be followed:

- We can buy and sell the stock any number of times.
- In order to sell the stock, we need to first buy it on the same or any previous day.
- We can’t buy a stock again after buying it once. In other words, we first buy a stock and then sell it.
  After selling we can buy and sell again. But we can’t sell before buying and can’t buy before selling any previously bought stock.
- We can do at most 2 transactions
