Let us first understand what a bitonic subsequence means.

A bitonic subsequence is a subsequence of an array in which the elements can be any of these three:

- First, increase till a point and then decrease.
- Goes on increasing (Longest increasing subsequence)
- Goes on decreasing (Longest decreasing subsequence)
```

Example
```
1,2,1,2,1
3
```
