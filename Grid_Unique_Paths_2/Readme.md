```
We are given an “N*M” Maze.
The maze contains some obstacles.
A cell is ‘blockage’ in the maze if its value is -1.
0 represents non-blockage. There is no path possible through a blocked cell.

We need to count the total number of unique paths from the top-left corner of the maze to the bottom-right corner.
At every cell, we can move either down or towards the right.
