Problem statement
Given an array ‘A’ consisting of ‘N’ integers and an integer ‘B’,
find the number of subarrays of array ‘A’ whose bitwise XOR( ⊕ ) of all elements is equal to ‘B’.

A subarray of an array is obtained by removing some(zero or more) elements from the front and back of the array.

```
```
Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 4 ‘B’ = 2
‘A’ = [1, 2, 3, 2]

Output: 3

Explanation: Subarrays have bitwise xor equal to ‘2’ are: [1, 2, 3, 2], [2], [2].
```
