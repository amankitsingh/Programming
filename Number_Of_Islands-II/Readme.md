You are given a n,m which means the row and column of the 2D matrix and an array of  size k denoting the number of operations.
 Matrix elements is 0 if there is water or 1 if there is land. Originally, the 2D matrix is all 0 which means there is no land in the matrix.
The array has k operator(s) and each operator has two integer A[i][0], A[i][1] means that you can change the cell matrix[A[i][0]][A[i][1]] from sea to island.
Return how many island are there in the matrix after each operation.You need to return an array of size k.
Note : An island means group of 1s such that they share a common side.
```

Example
```
Input: n = 4
m = 5
k = 4
A = {{1,1},{0,1},{3,3},{3,4}}

Output: 1 1 2 2
