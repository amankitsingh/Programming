```
A subset/subsequence is a contiguous or non-contiguous part of an array, where elements appear in the same order as the original array.
For example, for the array: [2,3,1] , the subsequences will be [
{2},{3},{1},{2,3},{2,1},{3,1},{2,3,1}} but {3,2} is not a subsequence
because its elements are not in the same order as the original array.

We are given an array ‘ARR’ with N positive integers.
We need to find if there is a subset in “ARR” with a sum equal to K.
If there is, return true else return false.
