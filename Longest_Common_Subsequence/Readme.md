```
Given two strings, 'S' and 'T' with lengths 'M' and 'N', find the length of the 'Longest Common Subsequence'.
For a string 'str'(per se) of length K, the subsequences are the strings containing characters in the same
relative order as they are present in 'str,'
but not necessarily contiguous. Subsequences contain all the strings of length varying from 0 to K.
```

Example:

```
adebc
dcadb

3
