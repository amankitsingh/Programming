```
We are given an “N*M” matrix of integers.
We need to find a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix, such that there is a minimum cost past that we select.

At every cell, we can move in only two directions: right and bottom.
The cost of a path is given as the sum of values of cells of the given matrix.
```
