In this article, we will solve the most asked coding interview problem: Grid Unique Paths

Given two values M and N, which represent a matrix[M][N].
We need to find the total unique paths from the top-left cell (matrix[0][0]) to the rightmost cell (matrix[M-1][N-1]).

At any cell we are allowed to move in only two directions:- bottom and right.
